# Description
I wrote this to save me the time from a billion CTRL-F's to google--then quizlet, for me to get the answers, I was not planning on writing so but I tend to do this for quizzes more often than I would like. With that.. we may not be able to read a book.. but we can sure write some code.

# usage
```
usage: python3 quizlet.py -q <question>

Quizlet search for quick answers for quizzes

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -q QUESTION, --question QUESTION
                        specify question [or file] to search quizlet for the answers
  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
                        specify output file to save question and answers
  -v, --verbose         enable verbosity to output the requests sent
  ```

python3 quizlet.py -q "what is a covalent bond?"
```

  (1) Just copy and paste whole canvas and auto grab questions to search

  (2) AI for questions unanswered maybe? ðŸ‘€

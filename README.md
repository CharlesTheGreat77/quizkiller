# Description
I wrote this to save me the time from a billion CTRL-F's to google--then quizlet, for me to get the answers, I was not planning on writing so but I tend to do this for quizzes more often than I would like. With that.. we may not be able to read a book.. but we can sure write some code.

# usage
```
Usage of ./quizlet:
  -h    show usage
  -q string
        alias for --question
  -question string
        specify a question/file to query
  ```

# example
Single question look up
```
./quizlet -q "what is a covalent bond?"
```

# Multiple questions
Multiple question look up
```
./quizlet -q quiz.txt
```
- questions must be seperated by line

# Potential Addons
  (1) Just copy and paste whole canvas and auto grab questions to search

  (2) AI for questions unanswered maybe? 👀
